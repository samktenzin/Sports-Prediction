# NFL Weekly Scores Predictor/ Sam Khanal
## What is the purpose of this project?
Prediction of scores for upcoming nfl games in the current 2020 season from the upcoming week in the season till the end of the season. This is as a means to aid in betting choices in popular betting platforms such as Draftkings.
### How will this project start?
For the start of this project, I will be using the following API along with what the purpose of the api is for!

https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/nfl/odds/json/MatchupTrends/%7Bteam%7D/%7Bopponent%7D?key=

The key is not included in the readme file, but I do have my key to access the api.

(The purpose of this API is for the main predictions of the nfl games that are about to occur starting with week 7 of the current NFL season!)

Simply this api will make a prediction based on a matchup of two teams! The predictor of this api does take into account current stats of the teams offensively and defensively. 

#### Snippet of API Data

The user will be able to select a team from a dropdown menu of all teams on one side, and another dropdown menu of all teams on the other side. The layout will look as simple as (Select Team) vs. (Select Team)
Press the button that says who might win? The prediction based on matchup will give the user a result!
